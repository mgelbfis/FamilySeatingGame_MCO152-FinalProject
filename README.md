We would like to design a Shabbos Table Seating Game. This logic-puzzle game requires players to meet various restrictions and requirements to seat the family properly around the table. There will be some general rules applicable to all levels and puzzles. 
Examples of general rules include: 

*Males and females over age 9 cannot sit next to each other, unless they are close family members (parent-child, grandparent-grandchild, brother-sister, husband-wife)

*Children under age 1 must sit next to a parent or grandparent.

*Any couple within the first year of marriage must sit together

*Children under age 4 cannot sit next to the candles

Each scenario will also have specific rules. Examples:

*Child C spills a lot so he cannot sit next Guest G

*So-and-so was promised a seat next to Uncle U

We would like to include as many of these features as possible

*Players will receive points for completing puzzles

*Points will be awarded based on how quickly the player finishes the puzzle

*Puzzles with more than one solution will include preferences. Players will recieve points for each preference their solution meets

	Examples of preferences: Child C wants to sit next to children on both sides, Brother B wants to sit by the window

*Two player option with keyboard or GUI buzzer (The player that solves it first gets the points)

*Hints will be available with a penalty

*There will be a limited number of tries. Each wrong solution gets a penalty

*On each level, there will be several puzzles

*After completing a puzzle, the player will be shown the passcode for the next level

*If a player fails to solve the puzzle after a certain number of times, he will be moved down a level
